# Pirsch Analytics

This is the open-source core of [Pirsch Analytics](https://pirsch.io), a privacy-friendly web analytics solution. It originally started as an [experiment](https://marvinblum.de/blog/server-side-tracking-without-cookies-in-go-OxdzmGZ1Bl) to reliably analyze web traffic from the server-side using Go.

Pirsch is made in the EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º and hosted on German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª owned servers at [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/). You can find an interactive demo of what the dashboard looks like today [here](https://pirsch.pirsch.io).

## How does it work?

Pirsch generates a unique fingerprint for each visitor. The fingerprint is a hash of the visitors IP address, User-Agent, the date, and a salt.  The tracking works without invading the visitor's privacy. It doesn't use cookies and no personal information is stored, making it GDPR-, CCPA-, and PECR-compliant. If used on the server-side, Pirsch can track visitors using ad blockers.
